## Learning and Computing Resources

Computing on your own will form an essential part of the learning process and your own applied mathematics training. [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html) is available to all NYU students via our [ITS software service](https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/software/matlab.html) or via the [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/student.html) student webpage. You can install it on your personal laptop without a charge. The recitation leader will provide a Matlab tutorial in the first few sessions.

For beginner programmers I strongly suggest sticking to Matlab so you can focus on numerical analysis and not on programming per se. You are welcome to use Python if you are already familiar with programming and can learn how to use [numpy](https://numpy.org/) on your own. You are also welcome to use [Julia](https://julialang.org/learning/) if you are already familiar with it. 

For a quick tutorial see the [MATLAB Onramp](https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com). This is a 2-hour self-paced interactive course on the basics of using MATLAB. The other self-paced courses on that page are freely available to NYU and students can share completion certificates on LinkedIn.

To learn Matlab in more depth, consider these two sources:

### [Numerical Computing with Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/moler/chapters.html), C. Moler, SIAM 2004. This is a classic and free textbook written by the creator of Matlab.

### An Introduction to Programming and Numerical Methods in MATLAB, Stephen R. Otto & James P. Denier, Springer, 2005, available in [PDF format](http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-1-85233-919-7/contents/) through the library. This book provides an elementary introduction to Matlab with less focus on actual scientific computing.
