Homeworks will be submitted and graded via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com). No late homework is accepted without **prior** approval from the instructor, except for unforseen medical reasons with documentation.

[NYU academic integrity policies](http://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html) will be strictly enforced for homework assignments.
* It is OK to discuss with other students the mathematical aspects, algorithmic strategy, code design, techniques for debugging, and compare results. You must however **explicitly acknowledge any help that you receive from any source**.
* Each student must write the solutions independently. Copying of any portion of someone else's solution or allowing others to copy your solution is considered cheating.
* Code sharing is not allowed. You must type (or create from things you've typed using an editor, script, etc.) every character of code you use. There is no substitute for **debugging** your own code; looking at or copying someone else's code is not the same.
