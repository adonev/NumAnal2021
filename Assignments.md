Homeworks will be submitted and graded via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com). No late homework is accepted without **prior** approval from the instructor, except for unforseen medical reasons with documentation.

## Collaboration policy

[NYU academic integrity policies](http://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html) will be strictly enforced for homework assignments.
* It is OK to discuss with other students the mathematical aspects, algorithmic strategy, code design, techniques for debugging, and compare results. You must however **explicitly acknowledge any help that you receive from any source**.
* Each student must write the solutions independently. Copying of any portion of someone else's solution or allowing others to copy your solution is considered cheating.
* Code sharing is not allowed. You must type (or create from things you've typed using an editor, script, etc.) every character of code you use. There is no substitute for **debugging** your own code; looking at or copying someone else's code is not the same. 

## Instructions

Sometimes you will be required to submit code files but you are always encouraged do that if you used code to compute your answers. Instructions on how to do submit code files will follow. Always submit plain text files (extension .m for Matlab, or .py for python), and do not submit things like Matlab worksheets that cannot be opened in a simple text editor. Each problem should be a separate code, and please name your files reasonably so the grader can find the codes as needed.

Present your information effectively:

- Plot figures with thought and care! For example, errors should be plotted on a logarithmic scale, not linear, so you can see it going down instead of flat lines. The plots should have axes labels, tick marks, and legends, and be easy to understand at a glance.
- Export figures from Matlab or other plotting software to a scalable graphics format (.eps, .pdf, .dxf) rather than raster graphics or bitmaps . Vector graphics-based plots avoid pixelation
and thus look much cleaner. instead of raster graphics formats (.jpg, .png, .gif, .tif) in order to improve the quality and readability of the figures in the PDF (vector graphics-based plots avoid pixelation). In LaTex use PDF format with pdflatex.
- A picture is worth a thousand words! Instead of large tables, or printouts of Matlab matrices, make a plot. Do not submit pages of numbers unless there is a really good reason -- it is not an effective way to present the information.
- However, a picture by itself is not enough! You must write a concise explanation of the figure, especially what you learn from the figure (think of figure captions in scientific papers).
- If you do print things, use fprintf to format the output nicely instead of printing large matrices. Also use format compact and other format commands to control how MATLAB prints things.
