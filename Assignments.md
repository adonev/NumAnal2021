Homeworks will be submitted and graded via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com)

### 1. TBD

<!---

### 2. (Due Oct 4th) [Linear Systems](Assignments/Homework-LinearSystems.pdf)

Problem 1 and 3 can be solved based on material covered in the third lecture (LU factorization), and problem 2 after the fourth lecture (overdetermined linear systems).

Here is [code](Matlab/matinv.m) to compute the matrix inverse (taken from  [matrixlab](http://www.matrixlab-examples.com/matrix-inversion.html)). Try this code instead of the built-in function inv and compare.
