### 1 ([Feb 1 and Feb 3](Lectures/Introduction2021.pdf)). [Introduction to numerical analysis](Lectures/Introduction.pdf)

We will use the ancient yet still practical problem of [computing the square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method) to illustrate what numerical analysis is and look at first examples of Matlab codes ([Babylonian.m](Matlab/Nonlinear/Babylonian.m),  [BabylonianPlot.m](Matlab/Nonlinear/BabylonianPlot.m), [NonBabylonian.m](Matlab/Nonlinear/NonBabylonian.m), [SqrtTwoVar.m](Matlab/Nonlinear/SqrtTwoVar.m)). This will lead us into the topic of solving nonlinear equations.

Recitation leader will start doing Intro to Matlab ([week 1 intro](Matlab/matlab_tutorial_demo_week1.m)). Here are some notes on [Peculiarities of Matlab](Lectures/Matlab.pdf) for those with some programming experience.

### 2 ([Feb 8 and 10](Lectures/Nonlinear1D2021.pdf)). [Solving Nonlinear Equations in 1D](Lectures/NonlinearEqs.pdf)

We will study (try out and analyze) several methods for solving equations with one variable: bisection (code [Bisection.m](Matlab/Nonlinear/Bisection.m)), Newton's method (Babylonian method is an example), and the secant and Regula Falsi methods (code [Secant.m](Matlab/Nonlinear/Secant.m) -- as an exercise, add Newton's method to the plot and compare its rate of convergence to the secant method).

This covers sections 1.1 and 1.4-1.6 in Theory textbook (Suli & Mayers), but see also Definition 1.4. We will come back to fixed-point iteration (sections 1.2 and 1.3) as time permits, but for one example see the code [NonBabylonian.m](Matlab/Nonlinear/NonBabylonian.m) from the previous lecture.

### Extra [notes on solving nonlinear equations](Lectures/Nonlinear1D.pdf)

These are some typed-up notes based on my Scientific Computing class that cover solving nonlinear equations including systems of equations. Useful as a reference/summary **after** you cover and understand the class material.
