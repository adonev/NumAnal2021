# Numerical Analysis (MATH-UA.0252/MA-UY_4424)

This class will be online on zoom (scheduled via NYU classes) during the Spring of 2021, **Mon+Wed 2-3:15pm**. Recitation is tentatively presently scheduled for Fridays 11am-12:15pm but may be re-scheduled shortly to better fit remote students. 

All materials related to this course, including lecture notes, homeworks, schedule, etc., will be posted here. We will use [CampusWire](https://campuswire.com/) for a communication board for group work and questions (signup link will be sent via NYU Classes), and [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) for submitting and grading of homeworks and midterm.

The class content will be very similar to that taught by Prof. Georg Stadler [Fall 2018](https://cims.nyu.edu/~stadler/na18/), so consult that for an example of what to expect.

## Topics

We will cover classical topics in Numerical Analysis: The solution of linear and nonlinear equations, conditioning, least squares, numerical computation of eigenvalues, interpolation, quadrature, and numerical methods for ODEs. The course will have a focus on the analysis of numerical methods, but also require you to use numerical software (specifically Matlab, but if you have prior experience you are welcome to use Python (numpy), or Julia). If you are not familiar with any of these tools, the recitation will give an introduction to Matlab during the first weeks. Additionally, I  strongly recommend to work through one of the books listed below **before** the course starts or in the first weeks of the semester.

## Textbook

An Introduction to Numerical Analysis, Endre Suli and David Mayers, Cambridge University Press, 2003. Available electronically via NYU library proxy or from campus network in [PDF format](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-introduction-to-numerical-analysis/FD8BCAD7FE68002E2179DFF68B8B7237).

Additional learning materials for programming in Matlab including textbooks and tutorials are available in the [Resources tab](Resources.md)

## Grading

30% Homework, 10% Quizzes, 25% Midterm, 35% Final.
